RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
-------------------
1. We expect students to be honest and all the programs
   must be their own.  
2. Use of Internet, reference texts, cheat sheets (a.k.a. slips)
   is ALLOWED. 
3. Phone-a-Friend, Ask some one else to write the programs is
   NOT ALLOWED.  The person you are calling, or helping you
   can appear for the test instead :-). Once an offer is given
   he is not going to do the work for you.
4. We expect each of you to write the code for 5-6 hours. You
   can take breaks as needed. 
7. Be ready to explain how your program works.  If you didn't
   write it, we will know very easily. 

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

1. Go to the folder in which you have cloned.  A simple implementation
   for Echo is given to you already.  Go to the Echo directory and unzip
   the file for your favorite language. 
   Ex: If you write a program in C language unzip Echo-c.zip into the Echo directory. 
  
2. Now compile and run the program as per instructions below in command prompt.
  --> For compiling a program type "sh compile.sh".
  --> For running a program type "sh run.sh 'hi welcome to'"

3. Commit the changes and push them for testing. 

	1. Type "git add run.sh compile.sh Echo.[c/java/py]" to let git know what files to merge.
	2. Type "git commit -m "comments""
	3. Type "git push origin" to send the code for testing. 

4.You will receive a mail in a few minutes with the status of your program after automated test
  is complete.

5. Each program is allocated a maximum execution time.  If the program didn't finish 
   in the given time, it will be terminated, and the submission is considered a failure. 
   
6. Read each question carefully and make sure your output matches exactly what is requested. 
   Additional debugging output will invalidate your program. 
   
7. You should not read from stdin.  I.e. getch(), scanf(), System.in.read(), etc are now allowed. 
   All the input comes either from a file whose name is given as argument, or as arguments itself.
