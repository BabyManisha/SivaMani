Max Execution Time: 3 Secs

Objective of the program is to find increasing and decreasing patterns in the
given input and Hyphenize it based on the sequence found.  For example: abcde
can be hyphenized as a-e.  

Hyphenization should work for lower, capital and digits.  For example NO need
to recognize 101112 as a sequence of 10-12.  However 01234 should be recognized
as 0-4. At the same time 89:; should NOT be recognized as 8-; Similar lower and
upper case bounds should be honored. 

Your program should recognize both increasing and decreasing sequences.  I.e. a
string sequence of abcdefFEDCBA should be recognized as a-fF-A properly. 

A sequence of ABCDEDCBA should be recognized as A-E-A properly as well. 

3 Makes a sequence, not 2

(NOTE:  IF PARTIAL SCORING IS ALLOWED IN THE TEST, RECOGNIZING AT LEAST
ONE DIRECTION WILL GIVE YOU PARTIAL SCORE)
