
Maze            Score:15 
----            --------

Maximum execution time for this program : 6 sec

Objective of this program is to find the way out of a maze 20/20 (sample maze diagram
is shown below) starting from start point to end point.


In this diagram there are four possible directions to move from a cell: UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. 
This information can be used to write a binary code using 4 bits for UP, LEFT, RIGHT AND DOWN respectively. 
                                    
                                     UP                             UP
                                  +-------+                      +--   --+               Binary code for this cell
                                  |       |                      |       |               
                            LEFT  |       | RIGHT          LEFT  |         RIGHT           1011 => or B in Hexadecimal. 
                                  |       |                      |       |                
                                  +-------+                      +--   --+               
                                    DOWN                           DOWN                    
                                    
This notation can be further used to create a maze of any configuration by specifying the possible moves for each cell. 
See the sample file in this directory to understand how this maze is represented in hexadecimal numbers. 

You can make the following two assumptions to simplify the program: 
=> You will always enter the maze from the left hand side by moving Right.  Hence your starting move is always Right. 
=> You will exit the maze towards the right side.  Hence your last move is always Right as well. 
=> You can assume that there are no other exit points from the maze either on the top, or at the bottom. 

The maze is given in the below format

     +=====+=====+=====+=====+
     |     |     |     |     |                                         
     |     |                   => E
     |     |     |     |     |
     +=   =+=====+=   =+=====+
     |     |     |     |     |
     |                       |
     |     |     |     |     |
     +=   =+=====+=====+=====+
     |     |     |     |     |
     |                 |     |
     |     |     |     |     |
     +=   =+=====+=====+=   =+
     |     |     |     |     |
 S=>                         |
     |     |     |     |     |
     +=====+=====+=====+=====+


The input format is the file sample2.txt in this folder. 

Command to run:
---------------
sh run.sh sample2.txt

Expected output:
---------------
RUURRURR

If an input breaks any of the assumptions, or if there is no way out,
you should print "Invalid Maze configuration"
