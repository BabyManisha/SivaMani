Autotest - Instant test results
Autotest is a framework developed by SVPM Trust in collaboration with the trainees to conduct a technical competition for CSE and IT engineering students in Vijayawada, India area. This is open sourced to allow many such competitions to be held in the area to help improve the student standards.

Autotest consists of two servers. A git server that allows the contestants to push new revisions of their code and a test server that will monitor and test the changes.

Each contestant will be given multiple problems to solve, and they are expected to clone a starter repository and start pushing their solutions. Each solution should be kept in a specific directory. As changes are pushed into the server, they are tested for various cases and an immediate feedback is provided to them regarding passing and failing tests.

More information will be provided later in a Sphinx Doc project . . . .
